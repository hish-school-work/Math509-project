# Graphical Analysis

### Sentiment Label Distribution Pie Chart
This chart visualizes the distribution of sentiment categories—positive, neutral, and negative—based on daily tweet analysis over the five-year span from 2015 to 2019. The largest segment, approximately 41%, is composed of positive tweets, reflecting a generally optimistic tone in public sentiment regarding Tesla. Neutral tweets make up about 36% of the total, while negative tweets constitute the remaining 22%. This breakdown indicates that while Tesla enjoys substantial positive attention, there is still a significant amount of mixed and critical sentiment. From a financial modeling perspective, this sentiment distribution provides an important baseline, revealing how often the public mood aligns with or diverges from market optimism.

### Scatter Plot: Daily Return vs Average Sentiment
This plot illustrates the relationship between daily average tweet sentiment and corresponding daily stock return. While most data points cluster around the center—reflecting frequent occurrences of mild sentiment and low returns—there is a subtle positive trend. The trend line, derived from linear regression, suggests that days with higher average sentiment tend to be associated with slightly higher returns. However, the scatter is wide, indicating considerable noise in the relationship. This visualization supports our decision to investigate more complex models, as the linear correlation alone is insufficient for robust prediction but hints at an underlying pattern.

### Bar Plot: Average Return by Sentiment Label
This bar plot compares the average stock return on days categorized by dominant sentiment: positive, neutral, or negative. Interestingly, days with negative sentiment showed a slightly higher average return than neutral days. This counterintuitive observation might be attributed to market overreactions to negative news, followed by a price rebound, or the tendency of contrarian traders to buy on pessimistic sentiment. Meanwhile, neutral days show the least movement, reinforcing the idea that a lack of clear sentiment offers limited predictive value. This chart provides insight into potential nonlinear effects in sentiment-driven market reactions.

### Correlation Matrix Heatmap
The correlation matrix heatmap presents the strength and direction of the linear relationship between `avg_sentiment` and `return`. The correlation coefficient, approximately 0.23, signifies a weak but positive correlation. Though modest, this value suggests that sentiment is not entirely disconnected from market behavior. The heatmap, with its color gradient and labeled coefficients, provides a visual reinforcement that while `avg_sentiment` alone may not predict return with high accuracy, it is statistically associated with return movements and merits inclusion in further models.

### Posterior Distribution Plots (Bayesian Linear Regression)
These plots visualize the posterior distributions for the parameters α (intercept), β (sentiment effect), and σ (error or standard deviation of residuals) obtained from Bayesian linear regression. The distribution for β is centered around 0.21, with a 94% Highest Density Interval (HDI) ranging from 0.16 to 0.25. Crucially, this interval does not include zero, indicating a high probability that sentiment positively influences return. The narrow distribution for σ indicates that the model's uncertainty is low, and the parameter estimates are stable. These plots strengthen the statistical credibility of our claim that sentiment has a positive effect on returns.

### Bayesian Regression Line Plot with Uncertainty Bands
This chart overlays multiple regression lines drawn from the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model. Each line represents a possible linear relationship between sentiment and return, and together they form a credible interval band that reflects model uncertainty. The band is centered along a positively sloping line, supporting the conclusion that increases in sentiment are likely to correspond to increases in return. The inclusion of uncertainty bands, rather than a single regression line, makes this visualization particularly powerful in conveying both the direction and variability of the effect.

### Histogram of Prior Predictive Samples
This histogram evaluates whether our prior assumptions in the Bayesian model generate plausible outcomes. It displays the distribution of stock returns simulated from the priors alone—without observing the data. Most values fall within ±0.1 (±10% daily return), aligning with the actual historical behavior of Tesla stock. This validates the appropriateness of our prior choices and confirms that they do not predispose the model toward unrealistic return values. The chart is essential for demonstrating that the model starts from a sound baseline.

### Histogram Comparison: Posterior Predictive vs Actual Returns
This comparative histogram shows two distributions: the simulated returns from the Bayesian model's posterior predictive distribution and the actual observed returns. The close overlap between the two distributions is a strong indicator of model fit. This alignment means the Bayesian model successfully learned from the data and is capable of replicating real-world return behavior. A mismatch here would suggest model misfit or poor parameter estimation, so this chart is a crucial diagnostic tool for validating the model’s performance.

### Feature Importance Bar Chart (Random Forest)
This bar chart displays the relative importance of input features in the Random Forest model. Feature importance is calculated based on how much each feature reduces error across the ensemble of decision trees. `tweet_count`, representing the volume of Tesla-related tweets, emerged as the most important feature (32%), followed by `avg_sentiment` (29%), `rolling_sentiment_3` (20%), and `lagged_sentiment` (18%). The chart demonstrates that tweet volume—an indicator of public attention—has stronger predictive power than sentiment tone alone. It also underscores the value of temporal features, such as rolling averages and lagged sentiment, in capturing sentiment trends and their delayed effects on market behavior.

Each of these visualizations contributed to building a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between social sentiment and stock returns. From descriptive statistics and correlation checks to model diagnostics and feature analysis, the graphical outputs provided both intuitive insight and quantitative validation. Together, they reinforce the central conclusion of this project: that tweet sentiment, particularly when combined with volume and time-aware features, plays a measurable role in predicting Tesla's stock price movements.
